## Project specifications

**Responsive Design**

- Is the site UI compatible with a range of display sizes? -- All content is responsive and displays on a range of display sizes. -- Content should make use of available screen real estate and should display correctly at all screen sizes. --An image's associated title and text renders next to the image in all viewport sizes.
-Are images responsive? -- Images in the site are sized appropriate to the viewport and do not crowd or overlap other elements in the browser, regardless of viewport size.
-Are application elements visible and usable in all viewports? -- On the main page, restaurants and images are displayed in all viewports. The detail page includes a map, hours and reviews in all viewports.

**Accessibility**

- Are images accessible? -- All content-related images include appropriate alternate text that clearly describes the content of the image.
-Is focus used appropriately to allow easy navigation of the site? -- Focus is appropriately managed allowing users to noticeably tab through each of the important elements of the page. Modal or interstitial windows appropriately lock focus.
-Are site elements defined semantically? -- Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements. For those elements in which a semantic element is not available, appropriate ARIA roles are defined.

**Offline Availability**

- Are pages that have been visited available offline? --When available in the browser, the site uses a service worker to cache responses to requests for site assets. Visited pages are rendered when there is no network access.
